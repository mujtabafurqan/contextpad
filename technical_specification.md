ContextPad: Detailed Technical Specification
Product Overview
ContextPad is a web-based documentation editor that combines persistent context with AI-assisted writing to help developers create better technical documentation faster.
Core User Journey
1. User opens ContextPad in browser
2. User adds persistent context (codebase info, project details, team standards)
3. User writes initial draft in editor using markdown-style formatting OR writes initial prompt in the chat box and presses 'Submit' to allow AI to start generating
4. User reviews AI suggestions and accepts/rejects changes
5. User exports final document or copies to clipboard

Detailed Component Specifications
1. Context Panel (Left Side)
Functionality
* Persistent Context Area: Large textarea for context that persists across sessions
* Temporary Context Area: Textarea that gets cleared after each AI submission
* Context Templates: Dropdown with common context structures
* Character Count: Shows current context length for both areas
* Save State: Auto-saves persistent context to localStorage every 30 seconds
* Clear Button: One-click context clearing with confirmation (separate for each area)

Context Templates

- "Code Project": Repository info, tech stack, architecture overview
- "Feature Doc": User stories, acceptance criteria, technical requirements  
- "API Documentation": Service overview, authentication, error handling
- "Team Onboarding": Team structure, processes, tools, conventions
- "Custom": Blank template

Technical Requirements
* Maximum context length: 50,000 characters per area (roughly 12,500 tokens each)
* Real-time character counting with color coding (green < 20k, yellow < 40k, red > 40k)
* Visual separation between persistent and temporary context areas
* Auto-resize textareas based on content

Core Editing Features
* Markdown-Style Input: Real-time markdown parsing and rendering
* Supported Formatting:
    * Headers (H1-H6): # ## ### #### ##### ######
    * Bold: **text**
    * Italic: *text*
    * Code inline: `code`
    * Code blocks: language
    * Lists: - or * for bullets, 1. for numbered
    * Links: [text](url)
    * Tables: Basic pipe-separated format
Editor Interface
* Split View Toggle: Switch between edit/preview/split modes
* Line Numbers: Optional line numbering for easier reference
* Word Count: Live word and character count
* Auto-Save: Saves draft every 60 seconds to localStorage
* Undo/Redo: Standard text editing history (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
Document Management
* New Document: Clear editor and create fresh document
* Document Title: Editable title field above editor
* Last Modified: Timestamp of last change
* Document List: Simple dropdown of recent documents (last 10)
Technical Requirements
* Textarea with custom CSS for markdown highlighting
* Real-time preview rendering using marked.js or similar
* Keyboard shortcuts for common formatting
* Mobile-responsive design for tablet use

3. AI Enhancement System
"Submit" Button in Context Area
* Prominent Placement: Below temporary context area
* Loading States: Shows processing animation during AI calls
* Token Estimation: Shows estimated API cost before processing
* Rate Limiting: Prevents spam clicking (max 1 request per 10 seconds)

AI Processing Logic

javascript
// AI processes both persistent and temporary context
function submitToAI(persistentContext, temporaryContext, currentDocument) {
  const fullContext = combineContexts(persistentContext, temporaryContext);
  const prompt = buildPrompt(fullContext, currentDocument);
  const response = await callAI(prompt);
  clearTemporaryContext(); // Clear after submission
  return parseResponse(response);
}

Response Handling
* Diff Generation: Compare original vs AI version
* Change Highlighting: Visual indicators for additions, deletions, modifications
* Selective Acceptance: User can accept/reject individual changes
* Revert Option: One-click return to original version
Technical Requirements
* OpenAI API integration (GPT-4 recommended)
* Client-side diff algorithm
* Error handling for API failures
* Usage tracking and cost monitoring
* Auto-clear temporary context after successful submission

Diff Visualization
* GitHub-Style Interface: Red/green highlighting for changes
* Line-by-Line View: Clear indication of added/removed/modified lines
* Word-Level Precision: Highlights specific word changes within lines
Change Management
* Accept All: Apply all AI suggestions
* Reject All: Keep original version
* Individual Selection: Click to accept/reject specific changes
* Partial Acceptance: Accept parts of a change while rejecting others
